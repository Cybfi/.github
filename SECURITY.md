## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a security vulnerability, please create an issue at the `Cybfi/.github` repository or the repository assigned to the project. Use the "Security" tag so we can give it the highest priority. 
Please include the version number or commit hash, as well as include exactly how we can replicate the vulnerability. Please **do not** explain how to exploit the vulnerability. If this is relevant, email it to security@cybfi.dev privately!

**We consider security issues our highest priority. If any Cybfi employee knowingly creates a security vulnerability or disregards a valid vulnerability, we will take action! Please email us at security@cybfi.dev if this happens. We will investigate!**
